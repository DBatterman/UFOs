# UFOs

## Overview 

The purpose of this project was to build a website for our fictional client Dana. The site allows us to view data about UFO sitings, and filter it based on various criteria. In this case, we can view things by date, city, state, country, and the type of anomoly that the person saw.

## Results

We can use our filters to condense the data into the results we want. By simply typing what we want into the search boxes, the information we want will be displayed. This can be with only one filter or with multiple. 

With only one, things will look like this:

While with multiple, things get condensed even further

## Summary

The website is missing some filters as presently constructed. The data presented also has a 'duration' and a 'comments' section, but there aren't ways to search for them. So the first thing I would do to make our site even better is add those filters. The second thing I would do is to clean up the data a little bit. Right now the comments have a lot of random characters like & and # in it. Removing those will help when we add the filter that lets us search through the comments.
